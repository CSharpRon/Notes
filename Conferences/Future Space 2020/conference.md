Major General Lincoln for Space Force

- Mobilization assistant to the commander of U.S. Space Command
- Focus Areas:
    - Deter aggressions in space
    - Respond to conflicts
    - Provide defense capabilities
    - Developing partnerships with allies and other agencies to ensure that space remains a peaceful domain
- Warfighting in the Space Domain:
    - War is war, it really doesn't matter where it occurs.
        - Examples: Commercial ships shot down or boats getting pirated.
    - China demonstrated anti-satellite technology in 2007. What has changed is that now we are talking about it and US and our allies can publicly call out deterrants to space.
