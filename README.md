# Notes
A collection of personal development notes for code-related courses, conferences I attend etc.

# Usage
All of the notes are written with Markdown but may have LaTeX code embedded. 
For the best experience in reading the docs, use a markdown editor that has support for LaTeX like [MarkText](https://marktext.app/) or [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/)

# Copyright
These notes are my personal notes but are directly based on talks/teachings from others. 
Unless otherwise stated, my notes are a result of the hard work and research from others.
